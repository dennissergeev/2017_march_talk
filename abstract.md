Polar lows are usually characterized as small and short-lived maritime cyclones with near-surface winds exceeding 15 m/s. Even nowadays severe weather associated with polar lows makes them a serious hazard to ships, oil rigs and coastal communities in the high latitudes. The life cycle of each of these vortices is uniquely shaped by its environment. The chronic lack of in situ observations at high latitudes makes it challenging to forecast these explosive weather phenomena accurately. 

The first part of the talk briefly presents the evolution of a shear-line polar low, investigated using comprehensive observations obtained during the Aerosolâ€“Cloud Coupling And Climate Interactions in the Arctic (ACCACIA) field campaign, in conjunction with satellite data and high-resolution model simulations performed with the UK Met Office's Unified Model.
