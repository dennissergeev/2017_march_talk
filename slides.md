# What are polar lows?
<blockquote>
<em>Polar lows</em> are small (<b>100–500 km</b> in diameter), short-lived maritime depressions with near-surface winds exceeding <b>15 m/s</b>
</blockquote>
- A hazard to ships, oil rigs and coastal communities in the Arctic, North Atlantic and North Pacific
- Typical conditions give an [estimate](http://www.scisnack.com/2015/03/04/polar-lows-what-fuels-arctic-hurricanes/) of roughly $10^{18} J$ of the total <b>kinetic energy</b>.
- Their main energy sources are: air-sea heat fluxes, condensational heating; available potential and kinetic energy of large-scale flow.

# Where do polar lows occur?
* In the regions of frequent <b>cold-air outbreaks</b>
* Hundreds of polar mesoscale cyclones per year in each region
* More intense polar lows occur less frequently (in the Northern Hemisphere - mostly in winter)

<aside class="notes">
* There are some favourable locations for the development of polar lows.
* Typically in the regions prone to CAOs, where relatively cold continental air is advected over warm ice-free waters.
* Satellite-based climatological studies show that there are typically hundreds od PMCs per year

* This slide shows an example of a polar low that developed over the Norwegian Sea in late March 2013
* You can either look at the evolution of the clouds on the right (time goes from top to the bottom row)
* On the left the same PL is shown following the track
* Chains of mesoscale disturbances appeared around the synoptic low, forming the so-called merry-go-round signature
* The northerly flow converged into a line of intense vorticity (brownish colours)
* It was undulating and producing small instability waves
* The vorticity filament bent in half and curled up into a PL
* Later, the PL broke down into a bunch of smaller disturbances
* Its remnants were absorbed by a new stronger PL that formed close to the coast of Norway.

# Observations
<div class="w40" style="float: top;">
  <ul>
  <li>Data were gathered instrumented aircraft and dropsondes during ACCACIA field campaign</li>

<aside class="notes">
* So why is this case worth investigating? 
* Plus, shear-line cases are a bit underrepresented in PL studies. 
* But at the same time this case is typical of many mesoscale vortices forming on the edge of a cold-air outbreak.
* There are a lot of observations available, because it was probed by instrumented aircraft during the ACCACIA field campaign (purple line on the map)
* And it is rare: even today, there are only about a dozen of PLs observed with instrumented aircraft

* The dramatic change in weather conditions is evident from this video taken by one of the aircraft cameras.
* You can witness the windy and stormy conditions in the cold air mass, but as the aircraft crosses the cloud wall, the atmosphere becomes very calm and clear.

### Why is this important?
* Climate change in the Arctic can lead to a dramatic sea ice retreat
* It is still uncertain how it will affect polar low climatology

<aside class="notes">
* When I looked at the clouds and convergence line in the lee of Svalbard, it seemed that the northerly flow was deflected by Svalbard
* So I decided to change the orography mask in the model and see what happens
* I started with lowering the Svalbard mountains by a certain factor
* Then I got angry and just purged Svalbard from the land mask completely

# Experiment without Svalbard
<div class="w100">
  <img src="media/sic_oro_diff_ctrl_nosvalbard.png">
</div>
* Surface altitude of Svalbard is set to 0
* Sea ice is the same as in the control (CTRL) run


# without Svalbard
* Removing Svalbard has little impact on the polar low development
* Shown are contours of vorticity ($\zeta>=10^{-3} s^{-1}$) at 950 hPa

# How is it reflected in the backward trajectories?
* We use LAGRANTO model to calculate trajectories backward in time, starting from the polar low centre
* All the trajectories coloured by pressure value are shown below

<div class="w100">
  <img src="media/ctrl_nosvalbard_diff_traj_all.png">
</div>
<aside class="notes">
<p>The majority of air parcels that ended up in the PL sector have north and north-west origin</p>
<p>Atmospheric pressure does not change significantly along a single trajectory, implying the mesocyclones formed without interaction with the upper troposphere.</p>
<p>Air from the Svalbard region moves mostly within mid-tropospheric levels</p>
</aside>
# How is it reflected in the backward trajectories?
* Now only the trajectories that ended up in the boundary layer (below 850 hPa)

# Experiment with "fake" sea ice
<div class="w100">
  <img src="media/sic_oro_diff_ctrl_fake_seaice.png">
</div>
* Surface altitude of Svalbard is the same as in CTRL
* Sea ice edge is a straight line


# with "fake" sea ice
* Perturbing sea ice cover has bigger impact: the cyclone is displaced more
* Shown are contours of vorticity ($\zeta>=10^{-3} s^{-1}$) at 950 hPa

# without Svalbard AND with "fake" sea ice
* Two factors combined result in the biggest difference compared to CTRL run
* Shown are contours of vorticity ($\zeta>=10^{-3} s^{-1}$) at 950 hPa

* The existence of the polar low is determined by the atmospheric dynamics
* <em>But</em> the exact location and shape is influenced by surface factors
* Sea ice cover is more important than orography

## Future plans
* Run the model for other polar low cases
* Investigate how the sea ice cover affects polar low dynamics

* For a typical "merry-go-round" polar low 
* Real-life polar lows are a mess, but MetUM simulates them well
